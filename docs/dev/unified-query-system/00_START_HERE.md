# 🎯 START HERE - Unified Query System

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## 📍 **You Are Here**

This is the **MASTER INDEX** for the Unified Query System enhancement.

---

## 🚀 **For Developers** (Implementation)

### **Your Master Document**:
👉 **[`IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md)** 👈

This is your **single source of truth** for implementation:
- ✅ Current status
- ✅ What to build
- ✅ Phase-by-phase instructions
- ✅ Code examples
- ✅ Integration points
- ✅ Testing requirements

**Start reading there. Everything else is supporting documentation.**

---

## 📂 **Document Organization**

### **Phase 0: Planning & Setup** (Current)
| Document | Purpose | Who Reads |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **`00_START_HERE.md`** | Master index (this file) | Everyone |
| **`IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`** | Developer guide | **Developers** ⭐ |
| **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** | Technical deep dive | Architects, Senior Devs |
| **`PROJECT_HISTORY.md`** | Design decisions & feedback | Project Managers |

### **Phase 1-3: Implementation**
During implementation, refer to **`IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`** which includes:
- Phase 1: Simple Search Parser
- Phase 2: DataView Enhancement
- Phase 3: Smart/Chat Enhancement

### **Phase 4: User Documentation**
| Document | Purpose | Who Reads |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **`USER_GUIDE.md`** | End-user query guide | Plugin users |
| **`QUERY_SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md`** | Syntax reference | Plugin users |

---

## 📋 **Current Status**

```
Phase 0: Planning          ✅ COMPLETE
Phase 1: Simple Search     ⏳ READY TO START
Phase 2: DataView          📋 PLANNED
Phase 3: Smart/Chat        📋 PLANNED
Phase 4: User Docs         📋 PLANNED
```

## 🎯 **Quick Actions**

### **"I want to start implementation"**
→ Read [`IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md)

### **"I want to understand the architecture"**
→ Read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

### **"I want to see what changed"**
→ Read [`PROJECT_HISTORY.md`](./PROJECT_HISTORY.md)

### **"I want to write user documentation"**
→ Use [`QUERY_SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md`](./QUERY_SYNTAX_REFERENCE.md) as baseline

## ⚠️ **Deprecated Files**

These files were planning documents and are now consolidated:

- ~~`README.md`~~ → Replaced by `00_START_HERE.md`
- ~~`INDEX.md`~~ → Replaced by `00_START_HERE.md`
- ~~`SUMMARY_FOR_USER.md`~~ → Integrated into `PROJECT_HISTORY.md`
- ~~`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`~~ → Integrated into `IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`
- ~~`CLARIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`~~ → Replaced by `IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`
- ~~`ARCHITECTURE_REFINEMENT_2025-01-21.md`~~ → Integrated into `PROJECT_HISTORY.md`
- ~~`HYBRID_QUERY_ARCHITECTURE.md`~~ → Replaced by `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- ~~`UNIFIED_QUERY_SYSTEM_PLAN_2025-01-21.md`~~ → Original research, archived

**Action**: These will be moved to `_archive/` folder to keep workspace clean.

## ✅ **Next Steps**

1. **Read** [`IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER.md)
2. **Start** Phase 1 implementation
3. **Update** this file as phases complete
4. **Document** user guide in Phase 4
