### 🚀 Advanced Query Syntax

Task Chat supports powerful query syntaxes inspired by Todoist, DataView, and natural language processing:

#### **Todoist-Inspired Syntax** (~75% coverage)

Write queries using familiar Todoist patterns:

- **Keyword Search**: `search: meeting`, `search: "project review"`
- **Projects**: `##ProjectName`, `###SubProject`
- **Priorities**: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`
- **Status Filters**: (NEW)
  - `status:open` or `s:open` - Filter by status category
  - `status:completed`, `s:completed` - Completed tasks
  - `status:in-progress`, `s:wip` - In-progress tasks
  - `symbol:x` - Filter by exact checkbox symbol
  - `symbol:/`, `symbol:?` - Any custom symbol
- **Date Filters**:
  - `due before: May 5` - Tasks due before a date
  - `date before: Friday` - Tasks dated before
  - `due after: today` - Tasks due after
- **Special Keywords**:
  - `overdue` / `od` / `over due` - Overdue tasks
  - `recurring` - Recurring tasks
  - `subtask` - Subtasks only
  - `no date` / `!no date` - Tasks without/with dates
  - `no priority` - Tasks without priority
- **Logical Operators**:
  - `&` (AND) - Both conditions must match
  - `|` (OR) - Either condition matches
  - `!` (NOT) - Negation

**Examples:**
```
search: meeting & ##Work & p1
status:open & overdue & p1
##ProjectName & symbol:/ & !subtask
s:completed & due before: Friday
```

#### **DataView Duration Formats** (Day-Level Only)

Use concise DataView-style durations for date ranges:

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Days** | `7d`, `14 days` | Next 7/14 days |
| **Weeks** | `2w`, `4 weeks` | Next 2/4 weeks |
| **Months** | `3mo`, `6 months` | Next 3/6 months |
| **Years** | `1yr`, `2 years` | Next 1/2 years |
| **Combinations** | `1yr 2mo 3d` | Combined durations |

**Supported abbreviations:**
- Days: `d`, `day`, `days`
- Weeks: `w`, `wk`, `wks`, `week`, `weeks`
- Months: `mo`, `month`, `months`
- Years: `yr`, `yrs`, `year`, `years`

**Examples:**
```
7d                  → Tasks in next 7 days
2w                  → Tasks in next 2 weeks
3mo                 → Tasks in next 3 months
1yr 2mo 3d          → Tasks in next 1 year 2 months 3 days
```

**⚠️ Limitation:** Sub-day patterns (seconds, minutes, hours, time-of-day) are not supported because filtering uses date-only comparisons. Patterns like `30s`, `2h`, or `today at 2pm` will not work as expected.

#### **Natural Language Dates** (~95% coverage, Date-Only)

Powered by chrono-node for maximum flexibility:

- **Named Days**: `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `monday`, `sat`
- **Relative**: `next Friday`, `last Monday`, `in 2 weeks`
- **Date Ranges**: `Aug 17 - Aug 19`
- **Compound**: `2 weeks from now`, `5 days from now`

**Note:** Time components (e.g., `at 2pm`, `13:00`) are parsed but ignored because filtering uses date-only comparisons.

#### **Enhanced Relative Dates** (20+ patterns, Day-Level)

Flexible relative date expressions:

- **Past**: `5 days ago`, `2 weeks ago`, `1 year ago`, `-3 days`
- **Future**: `within 5 days`, `next 2 weeks`, `3 days`
- **Ranges**: `last 7 days`, `next 3 weeks`
- **Named**: `next week`, `first day` (of month)
- **Weekdays**: `sat`, `saturday`, `mon`, `monday`, etc.

**Examples:**
```
5 days ago          → Exact date 5 days past
-3 days             → Past 3 days range
next week           → Next week's date range
within 2 weeks      → Next 2 weeks
first day           → First day of current month
```

**Note:** Sub-day relative patterns (e.g., `+4 hours`, `30 minutes ago`) are not supported.

#### **Query Combinations**

Mix and match for powerful queries:

```
# Status + Priority + Date
status:open & p1 & overdue
s:wip & due before: Friday & ##Work

# Symbol + Project + Keywords
symbol:/ & ##ProjectName & search: review
symbol:? & next week & #urgent

# Complex combinations
status:open & !subtask & 7d & p2
s:completed & due before: Monday & #done
```

### 🎯 Task Display & Sorting
- **Multi-Criteria Sorting**: Tasks are sorted by multiple criteria in sequence
  - Primary sort applied first, secondary for ties, tertiary for further ties
  - Separate configurations for display vs. AI context
  - Fully customizable order per mode (Simple/Smart/Chat)
  - **Smart Internal Defaults**:
    - **Relevance**: Best matches first (score 100 → 0)
    - **Priority**: Highest first (1 → 2 → 3 → 4, where 1 maps to "high", "urgent", etc.)
    - **Due Date**: Most urgent first (overdue → today → future; no date = last)
    - **Created Date**: Newest first (recent tasks → older tasks)
    - **Alphabetical**: Natural A → Z order
  - **Auto Mode**: Intelligently picks relevance or due date based on query type
  - Default for Simple/Smart: Relevance → Due Date → Priority

- **Task Navigation**: One-click navigation to task location in notes
  - Preserves line numbers
  - Opens source file automatically
  - Works across all vault folders

### 🎚️ Quality Filter

Control how strictly tasks are filtered before display. Higher percentages = fewer but higher-quality results.

#### What is Quality Filtering?

After finding tasks that match your query, Task Chat scores each task based on:
1. **Keyword relevance** (default 20× weight) - How well keywords match
2. **Due date urgency** (default 4× weight) - How soon it's due  
3. **Priority level** (default 1× weight) - Task importance

These weights are configurable in Settings → Scoring Coefficients.

The Quality Filter removes low-scoring tasks, showing only results above your chosen threshold.

**Score Calculation (User-Configurable):**
```
Final Score = (Relevance × R) + (Due Date × D) + (Priority × P)

Default coefficients: R=20, D=4, P=1
Maximum: 31 points (with defaults)

Configure in Settings → Scoring Coefficients
```

#### Configuration

**Settings → Task Display → Quality Filter**

- **Slider:** 0-100%
- **Default:** 0% (Adaptive - recommended)

**Filter Levels:**

| Level | Percentage | Description | Use When |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Adaptive** | 0% | Auto-adjusts based on query | Recommended for most users |
| **Permissive** | 1-25% | Broad matching, more results | Exploring, semantic expansion |
| **Balanced** | 26-50% | Moderate quality filtering | Daily task management |
| **Strict** | 51-75% | Only strong matches | Specific requirements |
| **Very Strict** | 76-100% | Near-perfect matches only | Exact matching needed |

#### How to Choose

**Start with 0% (Adaptive)** - The system will automatically adjust based on:
- Number of keywords (more keywords = lower threshold)
- Semantic expansion detected (permissive threshold)
- Query complexity (simpler = higher threshold)

**Increase (30-50%)** if you're getting:
- Too many results
- Irrelevant tasks in results
- Need more focused matches

**Decrease (10-25%)** if you're getting:
- Too few results
- Missing relevant tasks
- Want broader exploration

#### Examples

**Query:** "fix urgent bug"  
**Semantic expansion:** 45 keywords total

| Filter | Threshold | Tasks Returned | Quality |
|--------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 0% (Adaptive) | Auto: ~10% | 12 tasks | All relevant matches |
| 25% | 7.8/31 points | 8 tasks | Removed weak matches |
| 50% | 15.5/31 points | 4 tasks | Strong relevance + metadata |
| 75% | 23.3/31 points | 1 task | Near-perfect match only |

**Query:** "overdue tasks" (Simple Search)  
**Keywords:** 2 words

| Filter | Threshold | Tasks Returned | Quality |
|--------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 0% (Adaptive) | Auto: ~26% | 15 tasks | Balanced quality |
| 50% | 0.6/1.2 points | 8 tasks | Moderate filtering |

#### Mode-Specific Behavior

**Simple Search:**
- Filters based on keyword matching only
- Score range: 0-1.2 points
- No semantic expansion
- Fast and straightforward

**Smart Search & Task Chat:**
- Filters on combined score (keywords + due date + priority)
- Score range: 0-31 points
- Uses semantic expansion
- More intelligent matching

**All modes:**
- Same percentage setting applies
- Automatically scales to appropriate score range
- Consistent behavior across plugin

#### Adaptive Mode Details

When set to 0%, threshold auto-adjusts:

| Keywords | Adaptive Threshold | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| 20+ | ~10% | Semantic expansion - be permissive |
| 4-19 | ~16% | Several keywords - balanced |
| 2-3 | ~26% | Few keywords - moderate |
| 1 | ~32% | Single keyword - stricter |

#### Tips

1. **Start with 0% (Adaptive)** - Works great for most users
2. **Too many results?** Gradually increase to 30%, then 50%
3. **Too few results?** Lower to 10-25% or return to 0%
4. **Semantic expansion queries** work best with 10-25%
5. **Exact queries** may need 50-75%
6. **Check console logs** to see actual threshold values

#### Technical Details

**Percentage to Threshold Conversion:**
```
Filter Strength (%) → Threshold (score)
25% → 7.75 points (keep tasks scoring ≥ 7.75)
50% → 15.5 points (keep tasks scoring ≥ 15.5)
75% → 23.25 points (keep tasks scoring ≥ 23.25)
```

**Safety Net:**
If threshold filters out too many tasks, the system keeps a minimum number to ensure you get results.

### ⚙️ Scoring Coefficients

**New in 2024-10-18:** Control how much each factor affects task scores. Configure in **Settings → Scoring Coefficients**.

#### What Are Scoring Coefficients?

Coefficients determine the weight of each scoring component. The final score formula:

```
Final Score = (Relevance × R) + (Due Date × D) + (Priority × P)
```

**Components:**
- **Relevance (R)**: How well keywords match (max base score: 1.2)
- **Due Date (D)**: How urgent (max base score: 1.5 for overdue)
- **Priority (P)**: How important (max base score: 1.0 for priority 1)

#### Default Coefficients

| Coefficient | Default | Range | Result with Defaults |
|-------------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| **Relevance** | 20 | 1-50 | 1.2 × 20 = 24 points |
| **Due Date** | 4 | 1-20 | 1.5 × 4 = 6 points |
| **Priority** | 1 | 1-20 | 1.0 × 1 = 1 point |
| **Max Score** | - | - | **31 points total** |

#### Common Configurations

**Keyword-Focused (R=30, D=2, P=1):**
- Emphasizes keyword matching
- Due dates less important
- Max score: 37 points
- **Use when:** Searching for specific content

**Urgency-Focused (R=20, D=10, P=5):**
- Emphasizes deadlines and priority
- Keywords still important
- Max score: 44 points
- **Use when:** Managing time-sensitive tasks

**Priority-Focused (R=15, D=3, P=10):**
- Emphasizes task importance
- Less weight on keywords
- Max score: 34 points
- **Use when:** Importance > urgency

**Balanced (R=20, D=4, P=1) - Default:**
- Good for most users
- Keywords weighted heavily
- Due date moderately important
- Priority as tiebreaker
- Max score: 31 points

#### How to Configure

1. Open **Settings → Task Display → Scoring Coefficients**
2. Adjust sliders for each coefficient
3. See max score update in real-time
4. Changes apply immediately to all search modes

#### When to Adjust

**Increase Relevance (R) if:**
- You do a lot of keyword searches
- Content matching is most important
- You want search-engine-like behavior

**Increase Due Date (D) if:**
- You're deadline-driven
- Overdue tasks should always appear first
- Time management is priority

**Increase Priority (P) if:**
- You use priority levels actively
- High-priority tasks should dominate
- Priority > due date in your workflow

#### Real-Time Max Score Display

The settings show your current maximum possible score:

```
📈 Maximum Possible Score: 31.0 points
Relevance: 24.0 + Due Date: 6.0 + Priority: 1.0
```

This updates instantly as you adjust coefficients, helping you understand the impact of your changes.

#### Impact on Quality Filter

Your coefficients affect the Quality Filter's threshold calculation:

```
Example: Quality Filter set to 25%

With defaults (R=20, D=4, P=1):
Max Score = 31 points
Threshold = 31 × 0.25 = 7.75 points

With keyword-focus (R=30, D=2, P=1):
Max Score = 37 points  
Threshold = 37 × 0.25 = 9.25 points (stricter!)
```

Same percentage, different absolute threshold based on your coefficients.

#### Tips

1. **Start with defaults** - They work well for most users
2. **Adjust gradually** - Change one coefficient at a time
3. **Test with queries** - See how results change
4. **Monitor max score** - Keep it reasonable (20-50 points)
5. **Quality filter adapts** - Automatically scales to your coefficients

### 🔧 Advanced Scoring Coefficients

**New in 2024-10-18:** For power users who want fine-grained control over every aspect of scoring.

#### What Are Advanced Coefficients?

Beyond the main coefficients (Relevance, Due Date, Priority), advanced coefficients let you control scoring at a detailed level **within each factor**.

**Most users don't need these!** The main three coefficients are sufficient for 95% of workflows. Advanced coefficients are for:
- Power users who want maximum control
- Users with very specific workflow requirements
- Users experimenting with scoring behavior

#### Relevance Sub-Coefficients

Control how keyword matching is scored:

| Sub-Coefficient | Default | Range | What It Does |
|-----------------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Core keyword match bonus** | 0.2 | 0.0-1.0 | **Additional bonus** for matching original query keywords (before expansion) |

**How it works:**
- Base scoring uses all keywords (core + semantic equivalents) with weight 1.0
- **Core keyword match bonus** adds extra points for exact query matches
- Set to **0** to treat all keywords equally (pure semantic search)
- Higher values prioritize exact query matches over semantic equivalents

**Example:**

With default (core bonus: 0.2):
- Task matches 2 of 2 core keywords: `2/2 × 0.2 = 0.2 points` (bonus)
- Task matches 15 of 20 expanded keywords: `15/20 × 1.0 = 0.75 points` (base)
- **Relevance base score:** `0.2 + 0.75 = 0.95` (before main coefficient)
- **Final relevance:** `0.95 × 20 (main coeff) = 19 points`

**When to adjust:**

*No Core Bonus (core: 0):*
- All keywords treated equally
- No preference for exact query matches
- **Use for:** Pure semantic searches

*Moderate Bonus (core: 0.2 - default):*
- Balanced approach
- Slight preference for exact matches
- **Use for:** General searches

*Strong Exact Match Focus (core: 0.5-1.0):*
- Strong bonus for original query terms
- Prioritizes precision over semantic breadth
- **Use for:** Precise, technical searches

**Tip:** The main **Relevance coefficient** (default: 20) controls overall importance of keyword matching. This core bonus fine-tunes whether exact matches matter more than semantic equivalents.

#### Due Date Sub-Coefficients

Control scoring at each time range:

| Time Range | Default | Range | Meaning |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Overdue** | 1.5 | 0.0-2.0 | Past due date (most urgent) |
| **Within 7 days** | 1.0 | 0.0-2.0 | Due within a week |
| **Within 1 month** | 0.5 | 0.0-2.0 | Due within 30 days |
| **After 1 month** | 0.2 | 0.0-2.0 | Due later than 30 days |
| **No due date** | 0.1 | 0.0-2.0 | No deadline set |

**Example:**

With defaults (overdue: 1.5, main coeff: 4):
- Overdue task: `1.5 × 4 = 6 points`
- Due in 3 days: `1.0 × 4 = 4 points`
- Due in 2 weeks: `0.5 × 4 = 2 points`

**Common Configurations:**

*Aggressive Urgency (overdue: 2.0, 7days: 1.0, rest: 0.1):*
- Overdue tasks heavily prioritized
- Far-future tasks largely ignored
- **Use for:** Deadline-driven, reactive workflow

*Balanced Timeline (overdue: 1.2, 7days: 0.8, month: 0.5, later: 0.3):*
- Smoother urgency curve
- All dates considered fairly
- **Use for:** Long-term planning, proactive workflow

*Future Focus (overdue: 0.5, 7days: 1.0, month: 0.8, later: 0.5):*
- Upcoming tasks prioritized over overdue
- Forward-looking rather than reactive
- **Use for:** Planning-focused workflow

#### Priority Sub-Coefficients

Control scoring at each priority level:

| Priority Level | Default | Range | Typical Mapping |
|----------------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **P1 (Highest)** | 1.0 | 0.0-1.0 | Urgent, critical, must-do |
| **P2 (High)** | 0.75 | 0.0-1.0 | Important, should-do |
| **P3 (Medium)** | 0.5 | 0.0-1.0 | Normal, regular tasks |
| **P4 (Low)** | 0.2 | 0.0-1.0 | Nice-to-have, optional |
| **No priority** | 0.1 | 0.0-1.0 | Unclassified tasks |

**Example:**

With defaults (P1: 1.0, main coeff: 1):
- P1 task: `1.0 × 1 = 1 point`
- P2 task: `0.75 × 1 = 0.75 points`
- P3 task: `0.5 × 1 = 0.5 points`

**Common Configurations:**

*Binary Priority (P1: 1.0, P2: 0.9, P3-4: 0.1):*
- Sharp distinction between high and low
- P1/P2 treated similarly (both "important")
- P3/P4 largely ignored
- **Use for:** Simple high/low workflow

*Graduated Priority (P1: 1.0, P2: 0.7, P3: 0.4, P4: 0.15):*
- Smooth progression between levels
- All levels clearly distinct
- **Use for:** Detailed priority management

*Flatten Priority (all: 0.5):*
- Priority doesn't matter much
- Focus on relevance and dates instead
- **Use for:** Priority-agnostic workflow

- Priority: 1 (standard)

**Sub-Coefficients:**
- Core weight: 0.3 (emphasize exact matches)
- All weight: 1.2 (but semantic still matters)
- Due date: All defaults
- Priority: All defaults

**Result:**
- Max score: `(1.2 × 30) + (1.5 × 2) + (1.0 × 1) = 40 points`
- Tasks matching query keywords heavily prioritized

- Due date: All defaults
- P1: 1.0
- P2: 0.6 (bigger drop from P1)
- P3: 0.3
- P4: 0.1
- None: 0.05

**Result:**
- Max score: `(1.2 × 15) + (1.5 × 3) + (1.0 × 10) = 32.5 points`
- High-priority tasks always on top
- Dates are tiebreakers only

**Use for:** Strategic planning, important vs urgent focus

### 📝 Tips for Advanced Users

#### Starting Out

1. **Use defaults first** - Test main coefficients before diving into advanced
2. **One change at a time** - Easier to understand impact
3. **Document your config** - Note why you chose values
4. **Compare before/after** - Run same query with different settings

#### When to Use Advanced Coefficients

**DO use them if:**
- Main coefficients aren't granular enough
- You have very specific workflow needs
- You understand the scoring system
- You're willing to experiment

**DON'T use them if:**
- You're new to the plugin
- Main coefficients work fine
- You don't want complexity
- You're unsure about impact

#### Testing Your Configuration

```
Test Query: "urgent bug fix due tomorrow priority 1"

Expected with defaults:
- Relevance: High (matches multiple keywords)
- Due Date: High (tomorrow = within 7 days)
- Priority: High (P1)
- Should appear at top of results

Expected with your config:
- Adjust expectations based on your coefficients
- Verify tasks rank as you intend
- Iterate if results don't match expectations
```

#### Common Pitfalls

**❌ Setting everything to max:**
- Makes all tasks score similarly
- Defeats purpose of differential scoring
- **Solution:** Vary coefficients to create meaningful differences

**❌ Too aggressive thresholds:**
- Overdue: 2.0, everything else: 0.1
- Only overdue tasks show up
- **Solution:** Smoother curves preserve more information

**❌ Ignoring base scores:**
- Sub-coefficients multiply with main coefficients
- Small main coeff + high sub-coeff = still small
- **Solution:** Adjust main coefficients first

### 💡 Advanced Tips

#### Property ORDER vs WEIGHT

**Important:** With user coefficients, **weight matters more than order!**

**Before (without user coefficients):**
- Sort order mattered: [relevance, dueDate, priority]
- First criterion dominated, others were tiebreakers

**Now (with user coefficients):**
- Coefficients determine importance: R=30, D=4, P=1
- Tasks scored as: `(R×30) + (D×4) + (P×1)`
- Relevance gets 30× weight → dominates regardless of order
- Order only matters for rare exact-score ties

**What to configure:**
- **Coefficients:** Control HOW MUCH each property matters
- **Sort order:** Select WHICH properties to include (not their importance)

**Example:**

```
Query: "fix bug"
Task A: relevance=0.8, dueDate=1.5 (overdue), priority=1.0 (P1)
Task B: relevance=1.0, dueDate=0.5 (month away), priority=0.75 (P2)

With R=30, D=4, P=1:
Task A: (0.8×30) + (1.5×4) + (1.0×1) = 24 + 6 + 1 = 31 points
Task B: (1.0×30) + (0.5×4) + (0.75×1) = 30 + 2 + 0.75 = 32.75 points

Task B ranks higher despite being overdue-less, because:
- Perfect relevance match (1.0 vs 0.8)
- Relevance weighted 30×, difference = 6 points
- Due date weighted 4×, difference = 4 points
- Relevance wins!
```

#### Resetting to Defaults

The settings tab includes convenient reset buttons to restore default values:

**Available Reset Options:**
1. **Reset All Advanced** - Resets all 12 sub-coefficients (relevance, due date, priority)
2. **Reset Main Coefficients** - Resets Relevance: 20, Due Date: 4, Priority: 1
3. **Reset Core Bonus** - Resets core keyword match bonus: 0.2
4. **Reset Due Date** - Resets all 5 time-range scores
5. **Reset Priority** - Resets all 5 priority-level scores

**Default Values:**

  **Protection Model (ensures consistent task management):**
  
  **Fully Locked Categories (displayName + symbols cannot be modified):**
  - **Open** `[ ]` - Default Markdown open task (space character)
    - Required for all open tasks
    - Cannot be deleted or modified
  - **Other** - Catches all unassigned symbols automatically
    - Required as fallback category
    - Cannot be deleted or modified
  
  **Partially Locked Categories (displayName + symbols CAN be modified, but cannot delete):**
  - **Completed** `[x]` or `[X]` - Finished tasks
    - Core category for task management
    - You can change display name (e.g., "Done", "Finished") and symbols
    - Cannot delete (needed for filtering completed tasks)
  - **In progress** `[/]` - Tasks being worked on
    - Core category for active work
    - You can change display name (e.g., "Working", "Active") and symbols
    - Cannot delete (needed for progress tracking)
  - **Cancelled** `[-]` - Abandoned/cancelled tasks
    - Core category for task lifecycle
    - You can change display name (e.g., "Abandoned", "Dropped") and symbols
    - Cannot delete (needed for cancelled task tracking)
  
  **Custom Categories (fully editable and deletable):**
  - Add your own categories: Important `[!]`, Bookmark `[*]`, Waiting `[?]`, etc.
  - Fully customizable: category key, display name, symbols, score
  - Can be deleted anytime
  
  **Per-category Configuration:**
  - **Category key**: Internal identifier (e.g., "important", "bookmark")
    - camelCase recommended, no spaces
    - Locked for protected categories, editable for custom
  - **Display name**: Human-readable label (sentence case recommended)
    - Locked for fully locked categories (Open, Other)
    - Editable for partially locked (Completed, In progress, Cancelled)
    - Editable for custom categories
  - **Symbols**: Checkbox characters (comma-separated)
    - Examples: `x,X` or `!,I,b`
    - Locked for fully locked categories
    - Editable for partially locked and custom categories
  - **Score**: Weighting for task prioritization (0.0-1.0)
    - Higher score = higher importance in scoring
    - Examples: 1.0 (open), 0.8 (important), 0.2 (completed), 0.1 (cancelled)
    - Editable for ALL categories
  
  **Why This Protection Model?**
  - **Consistency**: 5 core categories ensure reliable task management across all search modes
  - **Flexibility**: Partially locked categories can be renamed/customized to match your workflow
  - **Safety**: Cannot accidentally delete core categories needed for filtering/sorting
  - **Extensibility**: Add unlimited custom categories for your specific needs
  
  **Practical Examples:**
  
  *Customize core categories to match your language:*
  - Change "Completed" → "完成" (Chinese) or "Klar" (Swedish)
  - Change symbols: `[x]` → `[✓]` or `[√]`
  - System respects your changes everywhere (AI, search, display)
  
  *Add custom categories for your workflow:*
  - Important: `[!]` with score 0.8
  
  *Don't want certain symbols?*
  - For partially locked categories, assign rare symbols: `[§]`, `[¶]`
  - Use custom categories with your preferred symbols instead
  - System automatically respects your symbol mappings
  
  **Integration:**
  - **Compatible with**: [DataView](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), [Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks), [Task Marker](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker)
  - **Theme recommendation**: For proper status symbol display, use compatible themes like [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal)
  - **AI Recognition**: System dynamically infers semantic terms from your display names for all search modes
- **Priority Mapping**: Define your own priority value mappings
  - Map any text value to priority levels 1-4
  - Support for multilingual priority values

## How the Three Chat Modes Work

Task Chat offers three distinct chat modes, each with **predictable behavior and costs**. Set your default in settings, override per-query in chat:

### 🚀 Simple Search (Default, Free)

**No AI, always $0**

```
Your Query → Regex Parsing → Task Filtering → Direct Results
```

**How it works:**
1. **Query Parsing**: Pattern matching extracts filters and keywords
2. **Stop Word Removal**: Removes "the", "a", "how", "what", etc.
3. **Task Filtering**: Applies filters (priority, due date, tags, etc.)
4. **Direct Results**: Displays filtered and sorted tasks

**Examples:**
- `"priority 1"` → Finds all priority 1 tasks
- `"due today"` → Finds tasks due today
- `"#work"` → Finds tasks with #work tag
- `"bug fix"` → Searches for "bug" and "fix" (removes stop words)

**When to use:**
- ✅ Quick searches and simple filters
- ✅ When you want instant, free results
- ✅ When you know exactly what you're looking for

**Cost:** Always $0

## Understanding Semantic Expansion

**Applies to: Smart Search and Task Chat modes only**

Semantic expansion is the core technology that enables multilingual and broader task discovery in Smart Search and Task Chat modes.

### What is Semantic Expansion?

**Direct Cross-Language Semantic Equivalence Generation**

For each keyword extracted from your query, the AI generates semantic equivalents **directly** in all your configured languages. This is **NOT literal translation** but conceptual equivalence.

**Key Concept:**
- Not "translate this word" → Literal word-for-word conversion
- But "how would you express this concept in language X?" → Contextual equivalents

### How It Works

**Step-by-Step Process:**

```
Your Query: "How to develop Task Chat plugin"
     ↓
1. AI Extracts Keywords: ["develop", "Task", "Chat", "plugin"]
     ↓
2. For EACH Keyword, Generate Semantic Equivalents in ALL Languages:
   
   "develop" →
     English (5): develop, build, create, implement, code
     中文 (5): 开发, 构建, 创建, 编程, 实现
     Svenska (5): utveckla, bygga, skapa, programmera, implementera
     Total: 15 equivalents
   
   "Task" →
     English (5): task, work, item, assignment, job
     中文 (5): 任务, 工作, 事项, 项目, 作业
     Svenska (5): uppgift, arbete, göra, uppdrag, ärende
     Total: 15 equivalents
   
   "Chat" →
     English (5): chat, conversation, talk, discussion, dialogue
     中文 (5): 聊天, 对话, 交流, 谈话, 沟通
     Svenska (5): chatt, konversation, prata, diskussion, samtal
     Total: 15 equivalents
   
   "plugin" →
     English (5): plugin, extension, addon, module, component
     中文 (5): 插件, 扩展, 附加组件, 模块, 组件
     Svenska (5): plugin, tillägg, modul, komponent, instick
     Total: 15 equivalents
     ↓
3. Total Keywords: 4 × 15 = 60 keywords for matching
     ↓
4. Search your vault for tasks containing ANY of these 60 keywords
```

### Expansion Math Explained

**The Formula:**

```
Per keyword, per language:     Your setting (default: 5)
Per keyword, all languages:    Setting × Number of languages
Entire query total:            Number of keywords × (Setting × Languages)
```

**Concrete Example:**

**Your settings:**
- Max expansions per language: `5`
- Query languages: `["English", "中文", "Svenska"]` (3 languages)

**Query:** "如何开发 Task Chat 插件"

**Calculation:**
```
Step 1: Extract keywords
  → ["开发", "Task", "Chat", "插件"] = 4 keywords

Step 2: Calculate per-keyword total
  → 5 per language × 3 languages = 15 per keyword

Step 3: Calculate query total
  → 4 keywords × 15 per keyword = 60 total keywords
```

**Result:** Your 4-keyword query expands to 60 keywords for comprehensive matching!

### Why NOT "Translation"?

**Translation (❌ Not what we do):**
```
开发 → Literally translate to English → "develop"
Task → Literally translate to Chinese → "任务"
```

**Semantic Equivalence (✅ What we actually do):**
```
开发 → "How do English speakers express 'development/building'?"
  → develop, build, create, implement, code, program, construct

Task → "How do Chinese speakers express 'task/work item'?"
  → 任务, 工作, 事项, 项目, 作业, 任务项
```

**Why this is better:**
- Captures full semantic range, not just one translation
- Generates context-appropriate terms
- Handles cultural/linguistic nuances
- Works naturally for mixed-language queries

### Mixed-Language Queries

**Scenario:** Your query mixes multiple languages

**Query:** "开发 plugin for Task管理"
- "开发" = Chinese
- "plugin" = English  
- "Task" = English
- "管理" = Chinese

**How expansion handles it:**

```
For EACH keyword (regardless of its original language):
  → Generate equivalents in ALL configured languages

"开发" (originally Chinese) →
  English: develop, build, create, implement, code
  中文: 开发, 构建, 创建, 编程, 实现
  Svenska: utveckla, bygga, skapa, programmera, implementera

"plugin" (originally English) →
  English: plugin, extension, addon, module, component
  中文: 插件, 扩展, 附加组件, 模块, 组件
  Svenska: plugin, tillägg, modul, komponent, instick
```

**Result:** Same comprehensive coverage regardless of query language mix!

### Settings Configuration

**Location:** Settings → Task Chat → Semantic Expansion

**Max keyword expansions per language** (Default: 5)
- Controls how many equivalents to generate per language
- Range: 1-15
- Higher = Better recall, more token usage
- Lower = Faster, cheaper, narrower matching

**Visual in settings shows:**
```
🧮 Expansion Math:
• Per keyword, per language: Your setting (default 5)
• Per keyword, all languages: Setting × Number of languages
• Entire query: (Keywords in query) × (Setting × Languages)

Example: Query "如何开发 Task Chat插件"
→ Extracts 4 keywords: [开发, Task, Chat, 插件]
→ With 5 per language × 3 languages = 15 per keyword
→ Total: 4 × 15 = 60 keywords for matching

⚡ Current: 5 per language × 3 languages = 15 per keyword
```

### Cost Impact

**Token Usage:**

Semantic expansion increases token usage for the query parsing step:

**Without expansion (Simple Search):**
- Tokens: ~0 (regex-based)
- Cost: $0

**With expansion (Smart Search):**
- Tokens: ~150-300 (depends on keyword count)
- Cost: ~$0.0001 per query
- Impact: Minimal

**With expansion + AI analysis (Task Chat):**
- Tokens: ~1,000-1,500 (expansion + analysis)
- Cost: ~$0.0021 per query
- Impact: Low for occasional use, moderate for heavy use

**Optimization tip:** Use Simple Search for quick lookups, Smart Search when you need broader/multilingual results.

### Benefits

**1. Cross-Language Task Discovery**
```
Query in English: "urgent meeting"
Finds tasks in ANY language:
  - English: "urgent meeting tomorrow"
  - Chinese: "紧急会议"
  - Swedish: "brådskande möte"
```

**2. Broader Semantic Coverage**
```
Query: "fix bug"
Also finds:
  - "repair error"
  - "resolve issue"
  - "debug problem"
  - "修复错误"
  - "fixa fel"
```

**3. Natural Mixed-Language Queries**
```
Query: "开发 plugin for Task管理"
Works perfectly! Each keyword expanded independently.
```

**4. No Special Cases**
- Proper nouns get expanded too
- Technical terms get context-appropriate equivalents
- Same process for all keywords

### When to Adjust Settings

**Increase max expansions (6-10) when:**
- ✅ You have diverse multilingual tasks
- ✅ Tasks use varied vocabulary
- ✅ You want maximum recall
- ✅ Token cost is not a concern

**Decrease max expansions (2-4) when:**
- ✅ You want faster, cheaper queries
- ✅ Your tasks use consistent vocabulary
- ✅ You mainly use one language
- ✅ Precision more important than recall

**Default (5) works well for:**
- ✅ Most users
- ✅ Balanced recall and precision
- ✅ Multilingual workflows
- ✅ Moderate token usage

### Troubleshooting

**Getting too few results?**
- Check console to see how many keywords were expanded
- Increase "Max keyword expansions per language" (try 7-10)
- Verify your languages are configured correctly
- Lower relevance threshold (Settings → Task Display)

**Getting too many irrelevant results?**
- Decrease "Max keyword expansions per language" (try 3-4)
- Raise relevance threshold (Settings → Task Display)
- Use more specific keywords in your query

**Other language not working?**
- Use English language names
- AI models may recognize English names better

Task Chat offers three modes with **predictable behavior and costs**. The **default chat mode** (configured in settings) is used for all new sessions. You can override it per-query using the dropdown in the chat interface:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Simple Search (Default) - Free                   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Regex parsing, no AI                           │
│ • Always $0                                      │
│ • Instant results                                │
│ • Best for: Quick searches, cost-free operation  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Smart Search - AI Keyword Expansion (~$0.0001)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • AI expands keywords to multilingual synonyms   │
│ • Direct results (no AI analysis)                │
│ • ~250 tokens per query                          │
│ • Best for: Multilingual, broader results        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • AI keyword expansion + analysis + insights     │
│ • Ranked recommendations with explanations       │
│ • ~1,000-1,500 tokens per query                  │
│ • Best for: Complex queries, AI prioritization   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How to Configure:**
- **Default mode**: Settings → Task Chat → **Default chat mode**
  - Select: Simple Search (free) | Smart Search (AI keywords) | Task Chat (full AI)
  - This applies to all new sessions
- **Per-query override**: Use dropdown in chat interface (top controls)
  - Changes mode for current query only
  - Doesn't change your default setting

**Mode-Specific Features:**
- **Simple Search**: Free, instant, no AI
- **Smart Search**: Multilingual keyword expansion, direct results
- **Task Chat**: AI analysis, recommendations, "Auto" sorting mode available

---

**Search Optimization Settings**

- **Max Direct Results** (default: 20)
  - Controls how many results to show for Simple/Smart Search modes
  - Task Chat mode analyzes up to this many tasks
  - Range: 5-100 tasks

- **Max Tasks for AI** (default: 30)
  - Only affects Task Chat mode
  - Controls how many tasks AI analyzes
  - Higher = more context for AI, higher token cost
  - Lower = faster, cheaper responses

- **Max Recommendations** (default: 20)
  - Only affects Task Chat mode
  - Final curated list size after AI analysis
  - Keep manageable for user review

---

**Language Settings**

- **Query Languages** (default: English, 中文)
  - Languages for semantic expansion in Smart Search and Task Chat modes
  - Simple Search mode doesn't use this (regex-based keyword matching only)
  - For EACH keyword, AI generates semantic equivalents in ALL these languages
  - More languages = broader cross-language matching but slightly more tokens
  - Example: English, Español, 中文, 日本語
  - **Tip:** Use English language names for better AI recognition

- **Response Language** (AI response preference)
  - Only affects Task Chat mode (only mode with AI responses)
  - Auto: AI detects and responds in the language matching your query
  - English: Always respond in English
  - Chinese: Always respond in Chinese (中文)
  - Custom: Define your own language instruction
  - **Note:** This only controls response language, not expansion languages

### Task Display Settings

**Sorting Options**
- **Task Sort By**: Field to sort tasks by
  - **Auto (AI-driven)** - ⭐ Only available in Task Chat mode
    - **Availability**: Only shown when default chat mode is set to "Task Chat"
    - AI intelligently chooses sorting based on query type
      - Keyword searches → Relevance sorting
      - Other queries → Due Date sorting
    - Best for: Task Chat mode users who want smart AI-driven sorting
  - **Relevance**: Keyword match quality score (works when query has keywords)
    - Scores tasks based on how well they match your search keywords
    - Works in all three modes
    - Best for: Finding most relevant tasks in keyword searches
  - **Due Date**: Sort by deadline
    - Best for: Time-sensitive task management
  - **Priority**: Sort by priority level (1-4)
    - Best for: Importance-based workflows
  - **Created Date**: Sort by creation time
    - Best for: Chronological task tracking
  - **Alphabetical**: Sort by task text
    - Best for: Organized browsing
- **Sort Direction**: Sort order
  - Low to High (ascending): 1→4, A→Z, Early→Late
  - High to Low (descending): 4→1, Z→A, Late→Early
- **Note**: "Auto" sorting is exclusive to Task Chat mode for AI-driven prioritization

**Result Limits** (controls cost and performance)
- **Max Direct Results** (default: 20, range: 5-100)
  - Tasks shown directly without AI analysis
  - No cost, instant results
  - Higher = more results before AI triggers
- **Max Tasks for AI** (default: 30, range: 5-100)
  - Tasks sent to AI for context
  - Affects token usage and cost
  - Higher = better AI understanding, higher cost
- **Max Recommendations** (default: 20, range: 5-100)
  - Final curated task list size
  - AI selects most relevant from analyzed tasks
  - Keep manageable for user

**Relevance Threshold** (Advanced - Tune for your needs)
- **Range**: 0-100 (default: 0 = system defaults)
- **What it does**: Sets base threshold for keyword matching in BOTH direct search and AI analysis
- **When it applies**: Only when "Sort tasks by" is set to "Relevance" AND query has keywords
- **How it works**: System applies intelligent adjustments around your base value:
  - 4+ keywords → **base - 10** (more lenient for complex queries)
  - 2-3 keywords → **base** (use your setting)
  - 1 keyword → **base + 10** (more strict for simple queries)
- **Unified behavior**: Same filtering rules apply whether using direct search or AI analysis

**Examples:**
| Your Setting | 4+ Keywords | 2-3 Keywords | 1 Keyword |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 0 (default) | 20 | 30 | 40 |
| 15 (lenient) | 5 | 15 | 25 |
| 25 (moderate) | 15 | 25 | 35 |
| 35 (strict) | 25 | 35 | 45 |
| 50 (very strict) | 40 | 50 | 60 |

**When to adjust**:
- **Getting too few results?** Lower the base (try 15-20)
  - Example: Setting 15 gives you (5/15/25) - more lenient across all queries
- **Getting too many irrelevant results?** Raise the base (try 40-50)
  - Example: Setting 40 gives you (30/40/50) - stricter across all queries
- **Different languages**: Multilingual queries often need lower base (15-25)
- **Keep 0 for smart defaults** - works well for most users!

**How scoring works**: Each keyword match = 15-20 points, multiple matches get bonuses
- Task matching 2 keywords = ~30-45 points
- Task matching 3 keywords = ~55-70 points
- Task matching 4+ keywords = ~70-90+ points

### DataView Integration

**Field Mapping**
Configure field names to match your task metadata format:

- **Due Date Field**: Default is `due`
  - Supports: `[due::2025-01-20]`
- **Created Date Field**: Default is `created`
- **Completed Date Field**: Default is `completed`
- **Priority Field**: Default is `priority`

**Priority Mapping** (Customizable, Todoist-style)
Map text values to numeric priority levels (1-4):
- **Level 1 (Highest)**: Default: `1, p1, high, highest`
  - Add your own: `urgent, critical`
- **Level 2 (High)**: Default: `2, p2, medium, med`
- **Level 3 (Medium/Low)**: Default: `3, p3, low`
- **Level 4 (None)**: Default: `4, p4, none`

System uses 1-4 internally for consistent filtering.

**Task Status Mapping** (Customizable)
Define which symbols represent each status:
- **Open**: Default: ` ` (space), empty
  - Standard: `- [ ] Task`
- **Completed**: Default: `x, X`
  - Standard: `- [x] Task`
- **In Progress**: Default: `/,  ~`
  - Standard: `- [/] Task`
- **Cancelled**: Default: `-`
  - Standard: `- [-] Task`

**Date Formats** (optional, for display)
- Due Date Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO standard)
- Created Date Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Completed Date Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Task Format

Task Chat works with standard Markdown tasks that include DataView metadata:

```markdown
- [x] Write blog post [due::2025-01-15] [p::high]
- [/] Review pull requests [due::2025-01-18] [p::medium]
```

**Supported Task Properties:**
- **Due Dates**: 
  - DataView format: `[due::YYYY-MM-DD]`
  - Example: `- [ ] Task [due::2025-01-20]`
  
- **Priority**: 
  - DataView format: `[p::high]`, `[p::1]`, `[p::p1]`
  - Custom values: Add in settings (e.g., `[p::urgent]`)
  
- **Status Indicators**: 
  - Open: `- [ ] Task`
  - Completed: `- [x] Task`
  - In Progress: `- [/] Task`
  - Cancelled: `- [-] Task`
  
- **Tags**: 
  - Standard Obsidian tags: `#work`, `#personal`, `#urgent`
  - Inline or at end of line
  
- **Folder Context**: Automatically detected from file path

**Complete Example:**
```markdown
## Projects

- [ ] Design new feature [due::2025-01-25] [p::high] #design #urgent
- [/] Write documentation [due::2025-01-20] [p::medium] #docs

```

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Power User Workflows

**1. Multi-Criteria Filtering**
```
"Show me high priority in-progress tasks in the projects folder due this week with #urgent tag"
```
→ Combines 5 filters: priority + status + folder + due date + tag

**2. Cross-Language Task Management**
```
Query in English: "development tasks"
Finds: "开发任务", "Task development", "Develop feature"
```
→ Semantic matching across languages

**3. Cost-Optimized Queries**
- Use simple, direct queries for routine checks
- Enable AI Query Parsing only when needed
- Adjust maxDirectResults to control AI trigger point

**4. Session Organization**
- Create separate sessions for different projects
- Use descriptive session names (auto-generated from first query)
- Switch sessions to maintain context

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks not showing up

**🔍 DataView Status Check:**

First, determine which scenario applies to you:

**Scenario A: DataView not installed/enabled**
- The chat view will show: ⚠️ "DataView plugin required"
- **Solution**: 
  1. Go to Settings → Community Plugins
  2. Browse and search for "DataView"
  3. Install and enable DataView
  4. Click "Refresh tasks" in Task Chat

**Scenario B: DataView enabled but searches return 0 results**
- DataView is working but you're getting no tasks
- The chat view will show: ℹ️ "DataView is enabled but no tasks found"
- **Most common causes:**

1. **DataView is still indexing** (most common!)
   - DataView needs time to index all your vault files
   - **Wait 10-30 seconds** after enabling DataView or opening Obsidian
   - Click "Refresh tasks" button in chat view
   - Check the status bar at the bottom of Obsidian - it may show "Dataview: indexing..."

2. **DataView index delay is too long**
   - Default delay is 2000ms (2 seconds), which can be slow for large vaults
   - **Solution**:
     - Go to Settings → DataView → "Index Delay"
     - Reduce from 2000ms to 500ms or 1000ms
     - Restart Obsidian or wait for re-indexing
     - Click "Refresh tasks" in Task Chat

3. **Task syntax issues**
   - Tasks must use proper Markdown checkbox syntax
   - **Correct format**: `- [ ] Task description`
   - **Incorrect**: `• [ ] Task` or `* [ ] Task` (bullets work, but checkboxes are better)
   - Check a few tasks in your vault to verify format

4. **Tasks in excluded folders**
   - DataView may be excluding certain folders
   - Check Settings → DataView → "Ignore Paths"
   - Make sure your task folders aren't excluded

**Quick diagnostic steps:**
1. Open console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I)
2. Search for `[Task Chat]` logs
3. Look for "DataView returned X pages" - if 0, DataView isn't working
4. Look for "Successfully processed X tasks" - this shows how many tasks were found

**Still not working?**
- Verify at least one task exists in your vault with format: `- [ ] Task name`
- Try creating a test note with a simple task
- Check DataView documentation: https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/

### AI not responding

1. Check your API key is entered correctly
2. Verify your API endpoint is correct
3. Ensure you have internet connection (except for Ollama)
4. Check the console for error messages (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I)

### Cannot navigate to tasks

1. Ensure the source file still exists
2. Try refreshing tasks
3. Check that line numbers are being captured correctly

### Understanding chat modes

**Which mode should I use?**
- **Simple Search**: Quick searches, simple filters, free operation
- **Smart Search**: Multilingual searches, broader keyword matching
- **Task Chat**: Complex questions, AI recommendations, task prioritization

**How do I switch modes?**
- **Set default**: Settings → Task Chat → Default chat mode dropdown
  - This sets the default for all new sessions
- **Override per-query**: Use dropdown in chat interface (top controls)
  - Temporarily changes mode for current query only

**Understanding costs:**
- **Simple Search**: Always $0 (no AI)
- **Smart Search**: ~$0.0001 per query (AI keyword expansion only)
- **Task Chat**: ~$0.0021 per query (full AI analysis)

**How to reduce costs?**
1. Use Simple Search as your default mode
2. Switch to Smart Search only when you need multilingual/broader results
3. Reserve Task Chat for when you want AI recommendations
4. Use Ollama for free local AI processing (all modes)

**Query not understood correctly?**
- Try Smart Search or Task Chat mode for better AI understanding
- Check Settings → Query Languages to ensure your language is listed
- Use more specific keywords or filters
- Check the console for extracted filters (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I)

**Getting too few results in Smart Search or Task Chat?**
- The relevance base threshold may be too strict for your language
- Go to Settings → Task Display → Relevance threshold
- **Quick fix**: Try setting to 15 (gives you 5/15/25 thresholds)
- **Understanding**: System will still adapt, but around a lower base
- **Tip**: Multilingual queries often need base of 15-20

**Getting too many irrelevant results?**
- The relevance base threshold may be too lenient
- Try raising base to 40-45 for more selective results across all queries
- Check console (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I) to see actual scores
- **Tip**: Look for log showing "Final adaptive threshold"

**Fine-tuning relevance threshold for your language:**
1. Start with default (0) and test typical queries
2. Open console (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I) and look for:
   ```
   "Using default adaptive base: 20 (4 keywords)"
   "Final adaptive threshold: 20 (base: 20, keywords: 4)"
   "Filtered to 6 relevant tasks"
   ```
3. Evaluate results:
   - **Too few results?** Lower base by 10-15
     - If default gives 20, try base 15 (→ thresholds become 5/15/25)
   - **Too many irrelevant?** Raise base by 10-15
     - If default gives 20, try base 30 (→ thresholds become 20/30/40)
4. Test with different query types (1 keyword, 2-3 keywords, 4+ keywords)
5. **Remember**: System always adapts around your base - you're shifting the whole curve!
